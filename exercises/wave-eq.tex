  \Exercise[label=odesincos] Let $f$ be a twice-differentiable function on $\mathbb{R}$ which is
  a solution of the ordinary differential equation
  \begin{equation}
    f''(t) + A^2 f(t) = 0\,,
  \end{equation}
  where $A$ is a non-zero real number. We additionally define the functions $g$ and $h$
  with
  \begin{align}
    g(t)&=f(t)\cos(At)-\frac{f'(t)}{A}\sin(At)\label{eq:csgdef}\,,\\
    h(t)&=f(t)\sin(At)+\frac{f'(t)}{A}\cos(At)\label{eq:cshdef}\,.
  \end{align}
  \Question Show that $g$ and $h$ are constant functions.
  \Question Deduce from the previous question that there exists two real numbers $a$ and $b$
  such that
  \begin{equation}
    f(t)=a\cos(At)+b\sin(At)\,.\label{eq:csfsol}
  \end{equation}
